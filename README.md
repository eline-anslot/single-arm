# Improving interim decisions for single-arm trials by adjusting for baseline covariates and intermediate endpoints

## Abstract 
Researchers must endeavour to minimize exposure to harmful and/or ineffective treatments and maximize exposure to effective ones. One approach to achieve this is using multi-stage designs that allow stopping an ongoing trial for futility and/or efficacy. Commonly used designs for single-arm trials include group sequential designs with error spending functions, and the Simon two-stage design for binary endpoints. In both designs, the decision at the interim analysis may be improved, without making additional assumptions, by considering baseline covariates and/or intermediate endpoints.

As participants usually enter the study at different times, some may not have reached their primary endpoint at the time of the interim analysis. However, they will possess other pertinent information such as baseline covariates and intermediate endpoints. Handling this as a missing data problem, prediction models are constructed to predict the primary endpoint of these subjects based on their available information. Our proposed interim estimator has the appealing property of being asymptotically unbiased, even when the prediction models are misspecified. When the prediction models are correct, the interim estimator is asymptotically efficient. A simulation study and data analysis were conducted to assess the operating characteristics of the proposed method. The results show a decrease in the chance of incorrectly stopping the trial for futility. This leads to an increase in power while controlling the type I error. Specifically, benefits are obtained with a) more partial information available relative to the total number of participants at interim, b) higher predictivity of the adjusted variable(s) and c) more correct prediction models.
